# harvardx_capstone_movielens
The final documents and scripts for Harvardx Capstone MovieLens project.

If the code reviewer lives in an area with slow internet, it is suggested that
the timeout parameter for the downloads be changed.  This can be found in both
the Butgereit_script.R and Butgereit_report.Rmd  It is set to 10 minutes by
default


      download_timeout <- 600 #seconds == 10 minutes

It is suggested (but it is not necessary) that the code reviewer run the R script first

      Butgereit_script.R
      
This will download the zip file, unzip the file, and make various intermediate R
data objects.  It will then generate and test the various models and print the RMSE
to the console

The report can be generated by knitting 

     Butgereit_report.Rmd
     
It will also down the zip file (if necessary), unzip the file (if necessary), and create
the intermediate r objects (if necessary), and then finally generate the report
